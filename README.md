### Simple WordPress plugin for creating and managing text shortcodes

#### Usage:

Download or clone this repository in the `plugins` folder. Activate the plugin from the WordPress backend. A new post type called `Shortcodes` will appear in the backend. When you create a post, you will be able to use its content across the site as a shortcode. 

#### Filters

As of now, there is one available filter `alp_posttype_args`. It allows you to modify the parameters of the shotcodes post type.
